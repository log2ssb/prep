Detailed Self-Introduction

Hi, my name is [Your Name], and I bring close to 10 years of industry experience in the areas of DevOps, Azure Cloud, Infrastructure Automation, and Software Configuration Management, with over 2 years of onsite experience in client-facing roles. I have a strong track record of delivering end-to-end DevOps solutions, driving process automation, and leading cross-functional teams in Agile environments.

Currently, I’m working as a DevOps Lead at Hexaware Technologies, where I lead DevOps initiatives for enterprise-scale projects, especially in the BFSI and Telecom domains. I’m responsible for architecting and maintaining CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps for full-stack applications (.NET, Angular, Java, SQL, Automation Testing), implementing GitFlow and trunk-based branching strategies, and integrating DevSecOps tools like Veracode, Fortify on Demand, and SonarCloud.

I have extensive hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure, including services such as Azure VMs, App Services, Application Gateway, Azure SQL MI, Key Vault, Azure Monitor, and more. I regularly use Terraform to provision infrastructure as code and have implemented Ansible playbooks for server configuration and application deployments across multi-node environments. Additionally, I’ve worked on 3-tier application deployments involving both IaaS and PaaS services.

Beyond the technical aspects, I also play a key leadership role:

I handle a team, guide them in day-to-day DevOps operations, assign tasks, and ensure smooth project execution.

I’ve actively conducted internal trainings for team members and stakeholders on Azure DevOps, Ansible, Git branching strategies, and overall DevOps best practices.

I take part in Agile ceremonies such as sprint planning, backlog grooming, retrospectives, and ensure all work is traceable via Azure Boards and Confluence.

I’ve also been part of the SoX and Compliance team, where I was responsible for managing ITRMP (IT Risk Management Plan) for the project. I ensured that all processes, access controls, and deployment practices were audit-ready and compliant with enterprise-level security standards.

In my previous roles at Vodafone (_VOIS), Cognizant, and KPIT, I contributed to cloud migration strategies, built reusable CI/CD frameworks, and handled large infrastructure footprints across Azure and VMware-based private cloud environments. I also supported legacy systems by modernizing their deployment pipelines and integrating security testing at every stage of development.

I hold the following certifications:

Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals

Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate

Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert

I’m passionate about enabling teams through automation, delivering secure and scalable infrastructure, and driving continuous improvement through DevOps culture and tooling. I look forward to roles where I can further leverage my expertise in cloud and DevOps, contribute to strategic decisions, and mentor others in the journey.

Thank you!
